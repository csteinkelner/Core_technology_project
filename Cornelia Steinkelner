Cornelia Steinkelner

Hi I'm Cornelia, I come from bigest city in Austria, Viena.
I was in the Artschool Herbststra√üe, where I learned about woodworking, gold smithing and ceramics. On top of that i learned how to work in a team, by writing my thesis with a partner. It required a lot of communication and organization.

Now i want to become a Webdeveloper, to work in a creative and technical field. 
In Codefactory I allready learned to work whith Github, HTML, CSS and even codeing whith Javascript is now easy for me.

In my freetime I like to draw, write stories, do Kendo and swimm.
