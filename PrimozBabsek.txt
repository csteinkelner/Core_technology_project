I am Primoz, fullstack web developer. Although I am most passionate for pure coding in Javascript and PHP rest assured I know HTML and CSS. 
I am originally from Slovenia but recently relocated to Austria, Vienna.

I used to play poker profesionally but passion for coding just grew to big and I couldnt resist it anymore, so here I am.

I am well knowleagable in latest technologies as well as those used for years.

In my free time I just learn new technologies for coding, do sports or explore the beautiful city of Vienna.
